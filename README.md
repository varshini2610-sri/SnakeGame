Project Title       :  Snake Game
Project Description :  This is a simple Snake Game implemented in Java, where the player controls a snake to eat food and 
                        grow in length while avoiding collisions with itself and the walls. The game features real-time 
                        movement, score tracking, and increasing difficulty as the  snake grows
